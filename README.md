# Unreachable Code Branch Bug in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, error in JavaScript: unreachable code branches within functions.  The `bug.js` file contains a function with a branch of code that can never be reached due to the preceding conditional logic. This highlights the importance of thorough code review and testing to prevent such issues. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.
